As the organizer of one of the largest .NET groups in New York City, I organized a talk on .NET MAUI before its official release in November. The session was live-streamed on YouTube and LinkedIn, reaching a broad audience. This event was featured on the home page of the .NET Foundation website and has gathered over 4,500 views.

To ensure a wider reach, I ran a marketing campaign for the event using [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/virtual-getting-started-with-net-maui-tickets-264925518357). The listing received positive feedback and helped attract more attendees to the session.

During the talk, Jesus introduced .NET MAUI to the audience and demonstrated building a sample cross-platform app using the framework. He also guided attendees on making backend API calls within the .NET MAUI environment. You can watch the full session [here](https://www.youtube.com/live/Gowr_23aIkw).
