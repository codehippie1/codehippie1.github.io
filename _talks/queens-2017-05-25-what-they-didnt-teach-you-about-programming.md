excerpt: 'My talk, "What They Didn’t Teach You About Programming," held at Austin Space in Forest Hills, Queens, was designed to go beyond the basics and delve into critical topics often overlooked in formal education. Sponsored by Microsoft’s TEALS, the event drew around 40 developers and students—a turnout I was proud of, especially for a tech talk held outside Manhattan. During the session, I covered foundational topics like compilers, stack and heap memory, and algorithms, sharing practical insights into how code interacts with a machine at every level. I also explained concepts such as RAM, virtual memory, data storage in binary, and the intricacies of threads and thread safety, ensuring each idea was accessible and relevant to attendees. The event was a chance to bridge the gap between academic knowledge and real-world industry needs, and I enjoyed providing attendees with a deeper understanding of the systems that underpin programming. It was a rewarding experience to engage with such an enthusiastic group and share knowledge that can directly impact their growth as developers.'

On May 25, 2017, I delivered a talk titled *"What They Didn’t Teach You About Programming"* at [Austin Space](https://www.theaustinspace.com/) in Forest Hills, Queens. This event tackled programming topics that often fall outside the traditional curriculum, drawing an engaged crowd of around 40 tech enthusiasts. Sponsored by [TEALS](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/teals), Microsoft’s initiative to expand computer science education, the evening began with a brief presentation and refreshments, creating a welcoming atmosphere for learning and discussion. The strong turnout, particularly in a remote location like Queens, reflected the success of my outreach and community engagement efforts.

During the session, I explored foundational but frequently overlooked programming concepts, starting with compilers and how they transform high-level code into machine-readable instructions. I then explained the journey of code through the stack and heap, offering insights into memory allocation and its significance for writing efficient code. Moving to algorithms, I emphasized their importance as the backbone of problem-solving in programming, showing how the right approach can optimize both speed and functionality.

The discussion also covered computer memory, diving into the roles of RAM and virtual memory, and how data is stored at the binary level in 0s and 1s. These essential concepts, which are often glossed over in traditional classrooms and bootcamps, were demystified to highlight their real-world implications. I also tackled threads and thread safety, providing relatable examples to illustrate the challenges and strategies for managing concurrent operations in modern applications.

In closing, I revisited core object-oriented programming principles, emphasizing their role in creating scalable and maintainable software. By addressing such a diverse range of technical topics in a practical and accessible way, I aimed to provide attendees with a more comprehensive understanding of programming. This event, held outside the typical Manhattan tech meetup circuit, underscored my commitment to bridging the gap between academic learning and industry needs.
