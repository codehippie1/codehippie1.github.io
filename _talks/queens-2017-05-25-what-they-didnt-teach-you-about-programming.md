At his "What They Didn’t Teach You About Programming" talk held on May 25, 2017, at [Austin Space](https://www.theaustinspace.com/) in Forest Hills, Queens, Aneesh Gopalakrishnan tackled topics that rarely make it into the traditional curriculum, drawing an engaged crowd of around 40 tech enthusiasts. [TEALS](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/teals), a Microsoft initiative aimed at expanding computer science education, sponsored the event, kicking off the evening with a brief presentation and refreshments, which set an inviting atmosphere for learning and discussion. The event’s strong turnout, especially in a remote location like Queens, was a testament to Aneesh’s knack for community engagement and marketing within the tech space.

Aneesh’s presentation delved into foundational yet often overlooked areas in programming—starting with the basics of compilers and how they transform high-level code into machine-readable instructions. He explained the journey of code through the stack and heap, helping the audience understand memory allocation and why it matters for efficient coding. Shifting focus to algorithms, Aneesh provided insights into the backbone of problem-solving in programming, showing the importance of selecting the right approach to achieve both speed and functionality.

He also took a deep dive into computer memory, discussing the roles of RAM and virtual memory and demystifying how data is stored at the binary level in 0s and 1s. These concepts, while essential for optimizing performance, often get minimal attention in coding bootcamps and classrooms, and Aneesh’s explanations provided clarity on their real-world implications. Threads and thread safety, another complex yet vital topic, were addressed with relatable examples, shedding light on the challenges and techniques for managing concurrent operations in modern applications.

In closing, Aneesh revisited core object-oriented programming principles, underscoring their importance in creating scalable, maintainable code. By covering such a diverse range of technical concepts in a practical, accessible manner, Aneesh provided the attendees with a more complete understanding of programming. This talk, held in an atypical tech meetup venue outside of Manhattan, highlighted not only Aneesh’s depth of expertise but also his commitment to bridging the gap between academic learning and industry requirements.
