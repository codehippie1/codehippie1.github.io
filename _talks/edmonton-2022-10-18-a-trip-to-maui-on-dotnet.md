In his October 18, 2022 talk for the Edmond .NET User Group, Aneesh Gopalakrishnan presented a deep dive into .NET MAUI (Multi-platform App UI), showcasing how to build cross-platform mobile and desktop applications with .NET’s latest UI framework. Aneesh did a live demo of building a cross-platform app - “Famous GitHub Repositories by year app” that connects to the GitHub API, allowing users to browse trending repositories. This hands-on example illustrated how .NET MAUI simplifies the development process by enabling a single codebase that targets Android, iOS, Windows, and macOS, saving time and resources for developers focused on multi-device applications.

Aneesh’s talk provided insight into .NET MAUI's strengths, including its support for native features across platforms, built-in cross-platform controls, and the ease of integrating with web services like GitHub’s API. He highlighted essential components of MAUI, such as layouts and control handling, to build responsive and intuitive interfaces. By connecting to GitHub’s API, the app demonstrated the framework's capability to handle RESTful data, showcasing MAUI’s ability to develop responsive and data-rich applications efficiently.

The talk also focused on overcoming common challenges in cross-platform development, such as platform-specific customization and handling data from web sources. Aneesh shared tips for optimizing API calls within MAUI and emphasized using asynchronous programming for smooth and efficient data handling. This approach enhances the performance and user experience, making applications more engaging and responsive.

Aneesh’s demonstration was a practical guide for developers interested in cross-platform solutions. By the end of the session, attendees had a clearer understanding of the steps involved in developing with .NET MAUI, from UI design to data integration and performance optimization. This session was part of Aneesh's broader mission to empower developers with practical skills in .NET, encouraging them to leverage modern tools for creating versatile applications across devices.

The event streamed live on three .NET User groups, Youtube and LinkedIn simultaneously.
