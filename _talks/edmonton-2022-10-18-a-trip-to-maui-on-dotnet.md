excerpt: "On October 18, 2022, I gave a talk on .NET MAUI at the Edmond .NET User Group, where I demonstrated how to build a “Famous GitHub Repositories by Year” app that connects to GitHub’s API. During the presentation, I showcased how .NET MAUI allows developers to create cross-platform applications for Android, iOS, Windows, and macOS using a single codebase, simplifying the development process. By diving into the app’s integration with GitHub’s API, I highlighted .NET MAUI’s capability to effectively handle RESTful data, giving attendees a clear understanding of the practical steps involved in creating responsive, multi-device applications with the framework."

On October 18, 2022, I gave a talk for the Edmond .NET User Group, diving into .NET MAUI (Multi-platform App UI) and showcasing how to build cross-platform mobile and desktop applications with .NET’s latest UI framework. During the session, I did a live demo of creating the “Famous GitHub Repositories by Year” app, which connects to the GitHub API, allowing users to browse trending repositories. This hands-on example demonstrated how .NET MAUI streamlines development by enabling a single codebase that targets Android, iOS, Windows, and macOS, saving time and resources for developers working on multi-device applications.

In the talk, I highlighted .NET MAUI's strengths, including its support for native features across platforms, built-in cross-platform controls, and its seamless integration with web services like GitHub’s API. I covered key components of MAUI, such as layouts and control handling, to create responsive and intuitive interfaces. The app’s integration with GitHub’s API showcased MAUI's ability to efficiently handle RESTful data, making it an excellent choice for developing responsive and data-rich applications.

I also addressed common challenges in cross-platform development, such as platform-specific customization and managing data from web sources. I shared tips on optimizing API calls within MAUI and emphasized the importance of using asynchronous programming to enhance performance and user experience. These strategies ensure applications are engaging, responsive, and optimized for multi-device deployment.

This session was a practical guide for developers interested in cross-platform solutions. By the end of the talk, attendees had a clearer understanding of the steps involved in developing with .NET MAUI, from UI design to data integration and performance optimization. My goal was to empower developers with practical skills in .NET and encourage them to leverage modern tools for creating versatile applications across devices.

The event streamed live across three .NET User Groups, YouTube, and LinkedIn simultaneously.
