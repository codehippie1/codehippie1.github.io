excerpt: "During Global Azure Bootcamp 2023 in New York City, I had the opportunity to present a comprehensive talk at Microsoft’s Times Square office, focusing on securing React applications with Azure Authentication using MSAL.js and related open-source libraries. This hybrid event, which was also live-streamed on YouTube, featured a live demo where I built a React app from scratch and implemented Azure-based authentication. In the demo, I showcased how to integrate MSAL.js to ensure robust security and seamlessly connect the React app with an ASP.NET Core API. The session emphasized best practices in cloud security for modern web applications and engaged both in-person and remote attendees with practical, hands-on examples."

During the Global Azure Bootcamp 2023 in New York City, I had the privilege of presenting at the Microsoft office in Times Square, focusing on security practices for ReactJS apps using Azure authentication. Hosted at the Microsoft Reactor, a vibrant tech community space for hands-on learning, my session was both in-person and live-streamed. I covered best practices for securing React apps using MSAL.js (Microsoft Authentication Library for JavaScript) and open-source libraries, demonstrating how to build secure authentication flows with Azure Active Directory. The goal was to help attendees explore secure login and access control in modern applications.

### About Global Azure Bootcamp
Global Azure Bootcamp is a worldwide, community-driven event that educates and engages developers, IT professionals, and tech enthusiasts on Microsoft Azure’s expansive capabilities. Held annually, it brings together experts and learners through workshops, presentations, and hands-on labs. The event covers a broad range of topics, from AI and machine learning to IoT, app development, and security. What makes it unique is its grassroots nature—sessions are organized by local user groups and Azure experts in over 100 countries, creating a global network for sharing knowledge, best practices, and innovations. This collaborative environment accelerates Azure adoption and strengthens the tech community through shared learning.

### Live Demo: Building Secure React Apps with Azure
During my talk, I conducted a live coding session to demonstrate how to build a React app from scratch, integrate Azure authentication, and connect it to an ASP.NET Core API backend. Starting with a blank project, I guided the audience through key steps to set up MSAL.js, including configurations for single sign-on and multi-tenant applications. This hands-on approach helped attendees see exactly how to implement secure authentication in their own projects.

I emphasized the flexibility of MSAL.js, showcasing how developers could customize login screens and secure user data using token-based access controls. To provide additional context, I shared the source code for the demo app, which is available on GitHub at [react-in-reactor](https://github.com/codehippie1/react-in-reactor). The demo also highlighted how MSAL.js’s authentication capabilities extend beyond React, making it adaptable for various frameworks and enterprise-level integrations.

### Securing API Calls with MSAL and ASP.NET Core
Beyond authentication, I delved into securing API calls between React and ASP.NET Core. I demonstrated how to use access tokens generated by MSAL for secure communication with the backend. This included a detailed explanation of how these tokens enable granular access control, ensuring users have appropriate permissions based on their Azure AD roles.

### Resources and Replay
The hybrid format of the event allowed attendees to participate both in-person at Times Square and online via live stream. The session can be watched on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_f9EOLN4Eo), with the starting timestamp for my talk available [here](https://www.youtube.com/live/L_f9EOLN4Eo?si=oUImlgW7J6pquwR9&t=7056).

### Key Takeaways
This session was a part of my ongoing effort to help developers build secure, scalable applications using modern tools like Azure and MSAL.js. By covering authentication, secure API communication, and token-based access controls, the talk equipped attendees with the knowledge and tools needed to strengthen their applications against security vulnerabilities. Whether in-person or online, the enthusiasm around these topics was inspiring, and I’m grateful for the opportunity to contribute to the Global Azure Bootcamp 2023.
