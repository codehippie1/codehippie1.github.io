Aneesh Gopalakrishnan's talk at the Microsoft office in Times Square for the Global Azure Bootcamp 2023 in New York City highlighted security practices for ReactJS apps using Azure authentication. The event was held at the Microsoft Reactor, a tech community space for hands-on learning and networking, with Aneesh leading an in-person and streamed session covering best practices for securing React apps. Using MSAL.js (Microsoft Authentication Library for JavaScript) and open-source libraries, he demonstrated how to build secure authentication flows with Azure Active Directory, allowing attendees to explore secure login and access control in modern applications.

Global Azure Bootcamp is a worldwide community-driven event dedicated to educating and engaging developers, IT professionals, and tech enthusiasts on Microsoft Azure's expansive capabilities. Organized annually, it brings together Azure experts and cloud enthusiasts to host a wide range of workshops, presentations, and hands-on labs focusing on Azure’s latest developments. Participants gain practical experience on a variety of Azure services, from AI and machine learning to IoT, security, and app development, making it a critical learning opportunity for anyone invested in cloud technology. The significance of the event lies in its grassroots nature: sessions are organized and hosted by local user groups and experts in more than 100 countries, making advanced cloud technology accessible and fostering a global network of Azure users who share insights, best practices, and innovations. This collaborative environment not only accelerates Azure adoption but also strengthens the global tech community through shared knowledge and skills development.

Throughout his presentation, Aneesh used a live demo to illustrate the process of building a React app from scratch, adding authentication with Azure, and integrating it into an ASP.NET Core API backend. Starting with a blank project, he guided the audience through key steps in setting up MSAL.js, explaining how each configuration could address different authentication needs, like single sign-on and multi-tenant applications. This hands-on approach made it easy for attendees to follow along and see firsthand how to implement secure authentication in their own projects. Details of the event can be found on the official Meetup pages ([NYC Mobile .NET Developers Group](https://www.meetup.com/nycmobiledev/events/293409928/) and [.NET Virtual User Group](https://www.meetup.com/dotnet-virtual-user-group/events/293412627/)) and on the [Microsoft Reactor page](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/reactor/events/19211/).

Aneesh’s live coding session provided a complete walkthrough of setting up MSAL authentication. He emphasized the flexibility of MSAL.js, showing how developers could customize login screens and secure user data through token-based access controls. His demo app source code, which is available on GitHub at [github.com/codehippie1/react-in-reactor](https://github.com/codehippie1/react-in-reactor), serves as a reference point for developers looking to integrate Azure authentication quickly and securely into their applications.

The hybrid format of the event meant that attendees could watch Aneesh's session live on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_f9EOLN4Eo) as well, with a timestamp marking the start of his talk [here](https://www.youtube.com/live/L_f9EOLN4Eo?si=oUImlgW7J6pquwR9&t=7056). He also explained how MSAL’s authentication capabilities extend beyond React, making it versatile for various frameworks and backend integrations, especially in enterprise-level security implementations.

The talk not only covered authentication but also delved into securing API calls between React and ASP.NET Core. Aneesh demonstrated how developers could ensure secure communication with the backend, using access tokens generated by MSAL for each API request. He provided a detailed breakdown of how these tokens enable granular access control, ensuring users have permissions based on their Azure AD roles.

As a part of the Global Azure Bootcamp 2023, Aneesh's session catered to both local attendees in Times Square and a global audience online. The event underscored the growing importance of robust authentication in web applications, equipping developers with tools and methods to build secure, scalable applications on Azure. The enthusiasm around these topics was palpable, with attendees leaving the session better equipped to build secure applications using Azure and MSAL.js.
