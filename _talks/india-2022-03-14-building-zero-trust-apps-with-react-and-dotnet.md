excerpt: "In my keynote at VIT-AP University's Q-HUB, I had the opportunity to engage with over 100 students and faculty members on the fundamentals of building secure APIs with ASP.NET Core and a ReactJS SPA. Hosted over MS Teams, my talk focused on zero-trust architecture and the importance of adopting security-first practices in web development. During the session, I conducted a live coding demo to illustrate best practices in token-based authentication and endpoint security. I shared insights into how zero-trust principles can be applied in modern APIs, making them more secure and resilient. My goal was to show students how they can leverage .NET and ReactJS skills to build scalable and secure web applications, equipping them with the knowledge needed to tackle real-world development challenges."

At [VIT-AP University's Q-HUB](https://qhub-vitap.github.io/Qhub-Website/), I delivered a keynote presentation on developing secure, zero-trust APIs in ASP.NET Core with a ReactJS single-page application (SPA) as the front end. [VIT-AP University](https://vitap.ac.in/) is known for its modern engineering programs and innovation-friendly atmosphere, and Q-HUB serves as an incubation center to inspire students in software development, machine learning, and security. The mission of Q-HUB aligns perfectly with my topic, as I aimed to encourage students to explore .NET, C#, and ReactJS—technologies foundational to many current and future career paths.

During my talk, conducted over MS Teams and attended by over 100 students and faculty, I explained the architecture of a secure API paired with a React front end, diving into the principles behind zero-trust security models. I introduced key concepts like token-based authentication, secure data flow, and API endpoint security, emphasizing their importance in building resilient web applications. The goal was to provide real-world context that showed the significance of these skills beyond theoretical coding knowledge.

Through a live coding demo, I walked students through building a React application that interfaces with a secure ASP.NET Core API. The demonstration focused on implementing essential security features using React and .NET, ensuring secure communication and protecting sensitive data. I encouraged students to view zero-trust principles as critical for modern web development, especially when integrating external systems or managing user data.

The event showcased how [VIT-AP University’s Q-HUB](https://qhub-vitap.github.io/Qhub-Website/) bridges the gap between classroom learning and practical, career-ready knowledge by actively engaging students with industry-relevant skills. My talk provided students with a clear view of how mastering .NET and ReactJS can pave the way for exciting careers in secure, scalable web application development.
