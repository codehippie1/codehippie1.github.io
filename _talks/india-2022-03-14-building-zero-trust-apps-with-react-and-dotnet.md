At VIT-AP University's [Q-HUB](https://qhub-vitap.github.io/Qhub-Website/), Aneesh Gopalakrishnan delivered a keynote presentation focusing on developing secure, zero-trust APIs in ASP.NET Core, with a ReactJS single-page application (SPA) as the front end. [VIT-AP University](https://vitap.ac.in/), known for its modern engineering programs and innovation-friendly atmosphere, promotes tech skills among students through Q-HUB, an incubation center designed to inspire students in areas like software development, machine learning, and security. Q-HUB’s mission aligns well with Aneesh’s topic, as he aimed to inspire students to dive into .NET, C#, and ReactJS technologies, which are foundational to many current and future career opportunities.

During his talk, conducted over MS Teams and attended by over 100 students and faculty, Aneesh illustrated the architecture of a secure API and React front end, explaining the principles behind zero-trust security models. He introduced students to key concepts such as token-based authentication, secure data flow, and API endpoint security, which are vital for building resilient web applications. This provided a real-world context that reinforced the importance of these skills beyond the theoretical knowledge of coding.

Aneesh’s live coding demo walked through building a React application that interfaces with a secure ASP.NET Core API. This demonstration highlighted how to implement essential security features using React and .NET, particularly focusing on ensuring secure communication and safeguarding sensitive data. Students were encouraged to consider zero-trust principles as critical elements in any modern web development project, particularly when integrating with external systems or handling user data.

The event demonstrated how VIT-AP University’s Q-HUB actively brings industry-relevant skills to its students, bridging classroom learning with practical, career-ready knowledge. This talk gave students a glimpse into what they can accomplish by mastering .NET and ReactJS, laying a strong foundation for careers in secure, scalable web application development.
