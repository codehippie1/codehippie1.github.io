excerpt: "In my February 2023 talk at the Pittsburgh .NET User Group, I demonstrated how to integrate a ReactJS SPA front end with a secure ASP.NET API backend, focusing on building interactive and scalable applications. I covered key concepts such as using Redux for state management, Bulma.io for streamlined UI design, and React Query for efficient data caching. I also highlighted how Orval JS can simplify API integration through automated query generation while emphasizing the importance of maintaining robust backend security throughout. The session, which was featured on Tech Jobs for Good, provided practical insights for modern web development."

In my talk, *ReactJS and ASP.NET: The Dynamic Duo of Web Development,* presented at the Pittsburgh .NET User Group on February 28, 2023, I conducted a live demo showcasing how to build a ReactJS SPA and an ASP.NET API app. I explored the integration of a secure ASP.NET API backend with a ReactJS single-page application (SPA) front end—a popular architecture for creating modern, full-stack web applications. This session, also featured on [Tech Jobs for Good](https://techjobsforgood.com/events/reactjs-and-aspnet-the-dynamic-duo-of-web-development), focused on how combining React and ASP.NET enables developers to build highly interactive, scalable applications with robust backend security.

During the session, I highlighted essential components for dynamic applications, such as using Redux for state management to handle complex data flows, particularly in larger SPAs. I also demonstrated the benefits of Bulma.io, a CSS framework, for quickly creating clean and responsive user interfaces. Query management was another focal point, where I discussed React Query’s caching capabilities for optimizing data fetching and minimizing unnecessary API calls. Additionally, I explained how Orval JS automates the generation of React hooks, ensuring smooth and accurate API integrations without excessive manual coding.

Throughout the talk, I emphasized the importance of securing the API layer, sharing best practices to safeguard backend services in this setup.
