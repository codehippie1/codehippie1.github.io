In this mixing of the most famous web technologies "ReactJS and ASP.NET: The Dynamic Duo of Web Development", Aneesh Gopalakrishnan did a live demo of building a reactJS SPA and aspnet API app. He consucted this talk at the Pittsburgh .NET User Group on February 28, 2023. He also explored how to integrate a secure ASP.NET API backend with a ReactJS single-page application (SPA) front end—a popular architecture for building modern, full-stack web applications. This session, featured on [Tech Jobs for Good](https://techjobsforgood.com/events/reactjs-and-aspnet-the-dynamic-duo-of-web-development), emphasized how combining React with ASP.NET allows developers to create highly interactive, scalable applications with strong backend security.

Aneesh highlighted essential elements for dynamic applications, such as using Redux for state management to handle complex data flows, especially in larger SPAs, and demonstrated the benefits of using Bulma.io, a CSS framework, to build clean, responsive user interfaces quickly. Another focal point was query management, where he discussed React Query’s caching capabilities to optimize data fetching and minimize unnecessary calls to the API. He also explained the use of Orval JS to automate the generation of React hooks, ensuring smooth and accurate API integrations without excessive manual coding.

Throughout the talk, Aneesh reinforced the importance of securing the API layer, providing insights into various best practices for safeguarding backend services in this setup.
