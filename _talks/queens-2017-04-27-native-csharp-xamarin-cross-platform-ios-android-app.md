Aneesh Gopalakrishnan’s talk on Native C# Xamarin Cross-Platform iOS/Android App Development, held at Austin Space in Forest Hills, Queens, on April 17, 2017, provided attendees with a hands-on guide to building mobile applications using C# and Xamarin. With over 35 seasoned developers and students in attendance, the event marked an impressive gathering in a remote Queens location, showcasing Aneesh’s marketing skills and dedication to bringing tech discussions to new locations beyond Manhattan. Supported by promotional efforts from the Queens Innovation Meetup Group and Good Coders NYC Meetup Group, the event drew attendees through extensive campaigns on Eventbrite, Meetup, and LinkedIn.

The talk began with a quick introduction to Xamarin and Mono, giving attendees a foundation in native app development. Aneesh then delved into Portable Class Libraries (PCLs) and .NET Standard Libraries, discussing their role in sharing code seamlessly across platforms. The demo app he built in real-time demonstrated these concepts effectively—it was designed to connect with GitHub’s APIs, allowing users to retrieve data on repository stars. By working with APIs, Aneesh illustrated the versatility of shared code for accessing data from external sources in a cross-platform context.

A significant portion of the presentation focused on building out the app’s user interface (UI) on both iOS and Android, making adjustments to enhance the app's aesthetic appeal and user experience. Aneesh also covered offline functionality, showing how to handle data retrieval and caching to maintain usability even without a constant internet connection. This section underscored how Xamarin allows developers to create flexible, robust apps with native functionality.

Toward the end of the session, Aneesh engaged the audience in a discussion about other cross-platform technologies, including React Native, NativeScript, and hybrid apps. This open conversation allowed attendees to compare Xamarin with alternative frameworks and gain insights into the strengths and limitations of each approach. The talk provided attendees with a practical understanding of C# in mobile development, highlighting Aneesh’s commitment to empowering developers with skills they could apply immediately.
