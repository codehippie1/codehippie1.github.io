excerpt: "In my talk on Native C# Xamarin Cross-Platform iOS/Android App Development at Austin Space in Forest Hills, I provided attendees with a practical guide to building mobile applications using Xamarin. I introduced core concepts in native app development, demonstrated how to share code across platforms with Portable Class Libraries, and led a live demo of an app that connected to GitHub APIs to fetch repository data. The event, which drew over 35 developers and students through extensive promotion, concluded with a discussion of cross-platform alternatives like React Native and NativeScript. My goal was to give attendees a well-rounded perspective on mobile development frameworks, equipping them with insights to choose the right tools for their projects."

On April 17, 2017, I gave a talk on Native C# Xamarin Cross-Platform iOS/Android App Development at Austin Space in Forest Hills, Queens. This session provided attendees with a hands-on guide to building mobile applications using C# and Xamarin. With over 35 seasoned developers and students in attendance, the event was a great success, especially given the remote Queens location. Supported by promotional efforts from the Queens Innovation Meetup Group and Good Coders NYC Meetup Group, along with campaigns on Eventbrite, Meetup, and LinkedIn, the turnout reflected my commitment to bringing tech discussions to areas beyond Manhattan.

The talk began with an introduction to Xamarin and Mono, offering a foundation in native app development. I then delved into Portable Class Libraries (PCLs) and .NET Standard Libraries, explaining their role in sharing code seamlessly across platforms. During the live demo, I built a sample app designed to connect with GitHub’s APIs to retrieve repository star data. By incorporating API calls, I showcased how shared code can be leveraged effectively for accessing external data in a cross-platform context.

A significant portion of the session focused on building the app’s user interface (UI) for both iOS and Android, demonstrating adjustments to enhance its aesthetic appeal and user experience. I also covered offline functionality, illustrating how to handle data retrieval and caching to maintain usability without a constant internet connection. This part of the presentation emphasized how Xamarin enables developers to create flexible, robust apps with native functionality.

Toward the end of the talk, I engaged the audience in a discussion about other cross-platform technologies, including React Native, NativeScript, and hybrid apps. This open conversation allowed attendees to compare Xamarin with alternative frameworks, gaining a clearer understanding of the strengths and limitations of each approach. The session concluded with practical insights into C# for mobile development, underscoring my dedication to empowering developers with skills they could apply immediately.

The event listing is still available on [Eventbrite here](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/native-c-xamarin-cross-platform-iosandroid-app-tickets-33626815711), and the code built during the live demo has been shared on GitHub for attendees to explore further.
