excerpt: "In my recent talk for the Pittsburgh .NET User Group (PGHDOTNET), I explored the practical applications of Semantic Kernel (SK), a lightweight open-source SDK that integrates AI capabilities into new and existing software. To demonstrate the power of SK, I built an interactive app designed to streamline communication with potential tech speakers by generating “call for proposal” content. Using a custom-built SK agent, I showcased how developers can automate email composition, including generating personalized subjects and confirming details with recipients before sending. The session provided attendees with valuable insights into the flexibility of SK, particularly in enhancing productivity for tasks like content creation and AI-assisted communication."

On May 11, 2024, I had the opportunity to present at the Pittsburgh .NET User Group (PGHDOTNET), where I introduced the open-source Semantic Kernel (SK), an SDK designed to help developers seamlessly integrate AI capabilities into their applications. Semantic Kernel is lightweight and accessible, making it suitable for both newcomers to AI and experienced developers looking to embed AI-powered workflows into their .NET projects. During the session, I highlighted how SK can enhance development by adding natural language processing and AI-driven automation, bringing adaptability to applications without requiring extensive overhauls of existing codebase.

In a live demonstration, I built a Semantic Kernel app capable of generating "call for proposal" content, specifically designed to invite potential tech speakers for future talks. Using an SK-powered agent, I demonstrated how developers can construct an AI-based workflow that dynamically generates personalized content, including email subjects, tailored messages, and follow-up questions. This example underscored how easily Semantic Kernel integrates with existing tools, allowing developers to tailor AI responses to meet specific business needs. The source code for the app created during this demo is available in my repository [here](https://github.com/codehippie1/aspnetcore-semantic-kernel).

The app I built showcased how SK can gather recipient details, confirm them with users, and finalize messages before sending. By simplifying repetitive communication tasks, this approach streamlines outreach efforts and ensures they remain personalized. This example highlighted SK's versatility in automating communication and content generation, significantly reducing manual overhead in professional settings.

The talk, available to watch on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5l88uGAAMeo), was an interactive session where participants gained hands-on insights into the SDK's practical uses. From automating content creation in tech outreach to general productivity applications, the session demonstrated the real-world benefits of integrating AI into .NET projects.
