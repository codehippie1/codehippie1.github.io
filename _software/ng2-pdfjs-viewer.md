<br />
Supporting a wide range of use cases, from inline PDF displays to blob and byte array handling, the library offers flexibility and robust customization options. By maintaining compatibility with the latest Angular versions and incorporating community-driven improvements, `ng2-pdfjs-viewer` continues to empower developers in creating interactive and secure PDF functionality in their projects. The library is open-source and available on [GitHub](https://github.com/intbot/ng2-pdfjs-viewer). The popularity of the library made it to a stack overflow tag where a community of users answer implementation related questions on stack overflow.

I created and have maintained the Angular library `ng2-pdfjs-viewer` for over seven years, with the goal of simplifying PDF integration in Angular applications. Built on top of Mozilla’s PDF.js, this library allows developers to seamlessly display PDF files either inline within components or in a new tab. Designed to be lightweight and easy to use, `ng2-pdfjs-viewer` supports Angular versions starting from Angular 2.0 and has only one core dependency: `@angular/core`. You can find the library on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ng2-pdfjs-viewer).

One of the most rewarding aspects of this library has been its widespread adoption within the developer community. Over the years, `ng2-pdfjs-viewer` has achieved over ***5 million downloads*** in total and consistently averages more than ***120,000*** downloads per month. These numbers reflect its utility and reliability, as well as the trust developers have placed in it for production-grade applications.

What makes `ng2-pdfjs-viewer` stand out is its simplicity combined with powerful features. It supports a range of use cases, allowing developers to work with PDFs hosted on servers, blobs, or byte arrays. The library offers robust event support for tasks such as document loading and page changes, making it ideal for creating interactive PDF experiences. It also provides access to the underlying viewer via `PDFViewerApplication` and `PDFViewerApplicationOptions`, enabling developers to tailor the behavior and appearance of the viewer to suit specific needs.

Maintaining compatibility with the latest Angular versions has been a priority, along with incorporating feedback and feature requests from the community. The open-source nature of the library has encouraged collaboration, and the source code, along with detailed documentation, is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/intbot/ng2-pdfjs-viewer). For me, the success of `ng2-pdfjs-viewer` is not just in the numbers but also in knowing that it has empowered developers to build streamlined, robust applications with excellent PDF viewing capabilities. The popularity of the library made it to a stack overflow tag where a community of users answer implementation related questions on stack overflow. See the top questions [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ng2-pdfjs-viewer?tab=Votes). It’s been an incredible journey to see the library grow and become a trusted tool for so many in the Angular ecosystem.
