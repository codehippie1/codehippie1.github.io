The **Farmers Market App** is an Android application I developed to connect users with local farmers' markets, offering a convenient platform to discover fresh, locally sourced produce. The app provides a comprehensive map of all farmers' markets in New York State, complete with a legend to identify markets supporting SNAP/EBT, Nutrition Program, Fresh Connect, and their operating seasons. Users can directly call or visit market websites from within the app and initiate navigation to any market location. Notably, the app functions offline, ensuring accessibility without an internet connection. Recognized for its utility, the Farmers Market App was listed among the top 10 farmers market apps by [LeapDroid](https://leapdroid.com/best-farmers-market-apps-of-2021-android/) in 2021. Available for download on the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.farmersmarket.app).

I developed the **Farmers Market App** to bridge the gap between consumers and local farmers' markets, promoting access to fresh, locally sourced produce. The app features a comprehensive map of all farmers' markets in New York State, accompanied by a detailed legend that identifies markets supporting SNAP/EBT, Nutrition Program, Fresh Connect, and their respective operating seasons. This functionality empowers users to make informed decisions about where to shop based on their preferences and needs.

Designed with user convenience in mind, the app allows users to directly call or visit market websites from within the interface and initiate navigation to any market location. A standout feature is its offline capability, enabling users to access market information without an internet connection, which is particularly useful in areas with limited connectivity. The app's commitment to user privacy is evident, as it requires no unnecessary permissions and is free from advertisements and in-app purchases.

In recognition of its utility and user-friendly design, the Farmers Market App was listed among the top 10 farmers market apps by [LeapDroid](https://leapdroid.com/best-farmers-market-apps-of-2021-android/) in 2021. This acknowledgment underscores the app's role in enhancing the farmers' market experience for users. The app is available for download on the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.farmersmarket.app), offering a reliable and accessible tool for anyone looking to explore and support local farmers' markets.
