I spearheaded the development and maintenance of the [DNF Summit website](https://www.dnfsummit.org/), an initiative by the .NET Foundation to showcase open-source projects and community engagements. From the initial ideation phase, I built the site using ASP.NET, ensuring a robust and scalable platform. I integrated SEO best practices to enhance visibility and crafted marketing content to promote the summit effectively. Additionally, I implemented live streaming capabilities directly within the website, facilitating seamless virtual events.

I led the development and maintenance of the **DNF Summit** website, a key platform for the .NET Foundation's community events. Starting from the initial concept, I built the site using ASP.NET, focusing on creating a robust and user-friendly experience. To enhance the site's reach, I implemented SEO strategies and developed targeted marketing content. A notable feature I added was the integration of live streaming directly on the website, enabling seamless virtual event experiences.

My involvement spanned multiple DNF Summit events, including those on [July 20, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VL0ewZ-0ruo&t=392s&pp=ygUKZG5mIHN1bW1pdA%3D%3D), October 18, 2022, [January 17, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHCi6i3P0xA&t=316s&pp=ygUKZG5mIHN1bW1pdA%3D%3D), and [September 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYi7GggFyxc&pp=ygUKZG5mIHN1bW1pdA%3D%3D). For each event, I ensured the website was updated with current agendas, speaker bios, and session information. I worked closely with the .NET Foundation's outreach team, participating in planning meetings and discussions to align the website's content and functionality with the events' objectives. Additionally, I coordinated with speakers for session submissions and managed the technical aspects of live streaming during the summits.
