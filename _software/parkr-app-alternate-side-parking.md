Parkr is a cross-platform app I developed to simplify alternate side parking management for residents of New York City and New Jersey. Initially launched on Android over a decade ago, it was later rewritten from Xamarin to React Native, allowing for a complete revamp of its structure and an expansion to iOS. With features like real-time parking suspension alerts, a detailed parking suspension calendar, and street parking maps, Parkr has become an essential tool for urban drivers navigating complex parking rules.

The app has seen over **62,000 downloads** on Android alone and continues to grow rapidly on iOS. Designed to save users from costly parking tickets, it’s particularly popular among New Yorkers and New Jersey residents. The app was also recognized by [NJ Tech Weekly](https://njtechweekly.com/grassroots-initiative-wants-to-brand-jersey-city-as-nations-silicon-backyard/) for its community impact and practical value. Parkr represents my commitment to creating technology that directly addresses everyday challenges, making life a little easier for city dwellers.

I developed the **Parkr app** to help residents navigate the complexities of alternate side parking, starting with the Android platform over a decade ago. Over time, I rewrote the app from Xamarin to React Native, completely revamping its architecture and launching it on iOS. This effort not only modernized the app but also expanded its reach to a broader audience across platforms.

While living in Jersey City, I donated the open-source Xamarin version of the app to the Code for Jersey City/Open JC non-profit. Along with the codebase, I conducted a knowledge transfer to support its continued development and deployment to help Jersey City residents avoid parking fines. This version was also used for fundraising and promoting Open JC initiatives.

After moving to New York City, I enhanced the app to include support for NYC-specific parking rules and requirements. Since then, the app has gained significant traction, with over **62,000 downloads** on Android and a rapidly growing user base on iOS. Parkr has been instrumental in saving New Yorkers and New Jersey residents from numerous parking tickets, thanks to features like street parking maps, parking suspension calendars, and real-time suspension alerts.

The app’s success was recognized by [NJ Tech Weekly](https://njtechweekly.com/grassroots-initiative-wants-to-brand-jersey-city-as-nations-silicon-backyard/), where it was featured on their homepage as an impactful local tech initiative. For me, Parkr isn’t just an app—it’s a way to give back to the community by simplifying a common urban challenge and providing a tool that makes life a little easier for thousands of residents.
