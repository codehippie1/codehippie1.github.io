excerpt: 'CSRF attacks are a real threat to legacy ASP.NET MVC apps, especially with today’s sophisticated cyber threat landscape. In my guide, I cover straightforward techniques to secure these applications without needing a full-scale rewrite. I dive into the risks posed by CSRF, highlight key defense mechanisms like tokens and validation techniques, and provide practical steps to implement these defenses effectively. For developers managing legacy systems, this guide ensures you can enhance security standards with minimal disruptions.'

In *[How to Secure Legacy ASP.NET MVC Against CSRF Attacks](https://www.red-gate.com/simple-talk/development/web/how-to-secure-legacy-asp-net-mvc-against-csrf-attacks)*, I dive into strategies for protecting older ASP.NET MVC applications from Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks—a critical security vulnerability often overlooked in legacy systems. In this article, I explain the mechanics of CSRF and why it’s crucial for any web application that accepts user input. I also provide practical, step-by-step guidance on implementing preventive measures, including the use of anti-forgery tokens, adjusting application configurations, and enhancing authentication protocols to secure data integrity.

To help readers better understand these concepts, I’ve published an open-source [working playground](https://github.com/codehippie1/csrf-plaground-aspnetmvc) where you can implement the checks and balances discussed in the article. This guide is designed to help developers safeguard their existing applications with minimal disruption, effectively bringing them up to speed on modern security practices in a straightforward, approachable way.
