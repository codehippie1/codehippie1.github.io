In How to Secure Legacy ASP.NET MVC Against CSRF Attacks, Aneesh Gopalakrishnan dives into strategies for protecting older ASP.NET MVC applications from Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks—a pressing security vulnerability often overlooked in legacy systems. In the article, he explains the mechanics of CSRF and why it's crucial for any web application accepting user input. He then provides practical, step-by-step guidance on implementing preventive measures, including leveraging anti-forgery tokens, adjusting application configurations, and enhancing authentication protocols to secure data integrity.

An open-source source code for all the concepts discussed in the article is published as a [working playground](https://github.com/codehippie1/csrf-plaground-aspnetmvc) for readers to understand by implementing the checks and balances.
