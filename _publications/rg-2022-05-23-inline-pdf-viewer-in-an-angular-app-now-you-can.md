Aneesh Gopalakrishnan’s article, ["Inline PDF Viewer in an Angular App? Now You Can!,"](https://www.red-gate.com/simple-talk/development/angular/inline-pdf-viewer-in-an-angular-app-now-you-can/) provides a thorough, hands-on guide to integrating PDF viewing directly within Angular applications. He introduces the idea with the challenges developers face when adding PDF viewing to web apps, typically resorting to plugins or external libraries with mixed results. Aneesh discusses the limitations of older options and emphasizes the flexibility of his approach using Angular components to embed PDFs without leaving the app environment.

The article details how to set up the [ng2-pdfjs-viewer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ng2-pdfjs-viewer)—a tool Aneesh himself authored—outlining the installation process, configuration, and customization options to suit a variety of application needs. Aneesh provides code snippets and step-by-step instructions for using this tool, making it accessible to developers at different skill levels. His approach ensures that users get a smooth, in-app viewing experience without needing third-party viewers. This article is a practical resource for Angular developers looking to create streamlined, interactive PDF functionality in their applications. An app built using ng-2pdfjs-viewer serves as a working backbone for this article. The source code is open and published [here](https://github.com/intbot/ng2-pdfjs-viewer/tree/master/SampleApp).
