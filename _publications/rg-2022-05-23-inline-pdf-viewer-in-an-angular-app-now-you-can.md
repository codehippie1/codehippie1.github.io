In my article, ["Inline PDF Viewer in an Angular App? Now You Can!"](https://www.red-gate.com/simple-talk/development/angular/inline-pdf-viewer-in-an-angular-app-now-you-can/), I provide a thorough, hands-on guide to integrating PDF viewing directly within Angular applications. I start by addressing the challenges developers face when adding PDF viewing to web apps, which often involve relying on plugins or external libraries with inconsistent results. I also discuss the limitations of older solutions and introduce a more flexible approach using Angular components to embed PDFs seamlessly within the app environment.

The article walks through setting up [ng2-pdfjs-viewer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ng2-pdfjs-viewer)—a tool I authored—outlining the installation process, configuration, and customization options to suit various application needs. I include code snippets and step-by-step instructions to make it accessible to developers of all experience levels. My approach ensures that users enjoy a smooth, in-app PDF viewing experience without the need for third-party viewers.

This article is a practical resource for Angular developers aiming to create streamlined, interactive PDF functionality in their applications. To help developers get started, I’ve included a working sample app built with `ng2-pdfjs-viewer`. The source code for the app is open and available [here](https://github.com/intbot/ng2-pdfjs-viewer/tree/master/SampleApp).
