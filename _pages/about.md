My journey in tech has been anything but ordinary, rooted in a passion for both innovation and community-building. Over the past two decades, I've worked across various sectors, from shaping forex platforms to creating tools for large-scale applications. My projects include **[Remitto](https://remittoapp.com/)**, a streamlined forex comparison app aimed at reshaping how users engage with forex providers, and **Parkr** ([android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jcasp.app&hl=en_US)/[iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/parkr-alternate-side-parking/id6503993830)), which tackles the persistent challenge of finding street parking in crowded cities. My open-source project, **[ng2-pdfjs-viewer](https://github.com/intbot/ng2-pdfjs-viewer)**, has been adopted widely within the Angular community with over **5.5 million downloads**, allowing developers to add seamless PDF viewing to their SPA applications.

My deep engagement with the New York startup ecosystem led me to found **[Startup+](https://startupplus.club/)**, a community of over 15,000 entrepreneurs and innovators. It’s more than just a network; it’s an interactive forum where visionaries connect, pitch, and refine their ideas. Hosting more than 75 pitch and networking events, Startup+ has fostered growth and provided opportunities for new ventures, with over 5,000 attendees actively participating in our events.

In my current role, I’m involved in designing and building secure, scalable systems, always with an eye toward future-proofing. I prioritize security by design and use principles like Zero Trust to ensure software resilience. AI integration has become a central part of my work, with tools like Semantic Kernel enabling adaptive, contextually intelligent solutions. I’m a firm believer in open-source contributions and mentorship as ways to give back to the community, providing others with the resources and guidance I benefited from along my journey.

Through a blend of real-world projects, tech talks, and community initiatives, I aim to foster innovation and knowledge-sharing in every environment. From hands-on development to strategic insights, I focus on creating solutions that are both technically sound and adaptable, always aiming to bridge gaps and build connections.
