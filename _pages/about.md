My journey in tech has been shaped by a strong focus on innovation and a commitment to building supportive communities within the industry. Over the past two decades, I've worked across various sectors, from shaping forex platforms to creating tools for large-scale applications. My projects include **[Remitto](https://remittoapp.com/)**, a streamlined forex comparison app aimed at reshaping how users engage with forex providers, and **Parkr** ([android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jcasp.app&hl=en_US)/[iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/parkr-alternate-side-parking/id6503993830)), which tackles the persistent challenge of finding street parking in crowded cities. My open-source project, **[ng2-pdfjs-viewer](https://github.com/intbot/ng2-pdfjs-viewer)**, has been adopted widely within the Angular community with over **5.5 million downloads**, allowing developers to add seamless PDF viewing to their SPA applications.

My deep engagement with the New York startup ecosystem led me to found **[Startup+](https://startupplus.club/)**, a community of over 15,000 entrepreneurs and innovators. It’s more than just a network; it’s an interactive forum where visionaries connect, pitch, and refine their ideas. Hosting more than 75 pitch and networking events, Startup+ has fostered growth and provided opportunities for new ventures, with over 5,000 attendees actively participating in our events.

In my current role, I’m involved in designing and building secure, scalable systems, always with an eye toward future-proofing. I prioritize security by design and use principles like Zero Trust to ensure software resilience. AI integration has become a central part of my work, with tools like Semantic Kernel enabling adaptive, contextually intelligent solutions. I’m a firm believer in open-source contributions and mentorship as ways to give back to the community, providing others with the resources and guidance I benefited from along my journey.

Through a blend of real-world projects, tech talks, and community initiatives, I aim to foster innovation and knowledge-sharing in every environment. From hands-on development to strategic insights, I focus on creating solutions that are both technically sound and adaptable, always aiming to bridge gaps and build connections.

<h2>Open Source Contributions</h2>
I've always believed in the power of open source to transform how we build and share technology, and I've had the chance to contribute to projects aimed at making life easier for developers. One of my more popular tools, `ng2-pdfjs-viewer`, helps Angular developers integrate PDF viewing seamlessly into their applications. Creating straightforward, user-focused tools like this has been my goal with many projects. My `aspnetcore-semantic-kernel` repository on GitHub, for instance, explores integrating AI capabilities with ASP.NET, offering ways to add semantic understanding and language processing to .NET applications.

Working with the .NET Foundation has also been rewarding, giving me the chance to support and guide the .NET community by contributing to knowledge-sharing efforts, tool-building, and helping establish good practices. For me, open source is all about making useful, accessible, and reliable tools that empower developers at every stage, whether they're just starting or have years of experience.

<h2>Technical Writing and Speaking Engagements</h2>
I enjoy writing and speaking on topics that can help other developers navigate this fast-changing industry. I’ve contributed to platforms like Redgate’s Simple Talk and DZone, where I’ve shared practical insights into areas like Cloudflare Turnstile, CSRF protection in ASP.NET MVC, and the Semantic Kernel. My "Zero to AI Hero" series on DZone is one I’m especially proud of, as it breaks down complex AI integrations into actionable steps for developers, making advanced capabilities more approachable.

Speaking at events is another way I like to engage with the community. I’ve had the chance to share insights at places like the Pittsburgh .NET User Group and Global Azure Bootcamp, where I’ve covered topics like secure ASP.NET APIs and cross-platform development with tools like Xamarin. I’ve also been able to connect with students at events like VITAP University’s Q-HUB, where I aim to inspire the next generation of developers. For me, the goal is to take complex topics and make them understandable, so developers leave with something practical they can implement.

<h2>Community Building and Mentorship</h2>
Building and supporting communities has been one of the most fulfilling parts of my career. As the founder of Startup+, a vibrant startup network in New York City, I’ve organized over 75 pitch and networking events, creating a space for entrepreneurs, developers, and investors to connect. Our community now has over 15,000 members, and it’s been amazing to see people come together to share ideas and resources.

Mentoring is also close to my heart. Through the Mentoring Club, I’ve been able to provide guidance to aspiring developers from diverse backgrounds, helping them navigate their career paths. My involvement with Microsoft TEALS has also given me the chance to support computer science education in high schools, bridging the gap between academia and industry. I believe strongly in sharing real-world programming skills with the next generation to set them up for success.

<h2>Professional Recognition and Industry Impact</h2>
I’ve been fortunate to receive recognition for my contributions, including the [Microsoft MVP award](https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-us/mvp/profile/e1dc42d5-ff3e-ed11-bba3-000d3a197333), which acknowledges my work within the .NET and developer communities. I’m also proud to be a [Fellow of the British Computer Society (FBCS)](https://www.bcs.org/membership-and-registrations/our-members/aneesh-gopalakrishnan-fbcs/), a recognition that highlights my commitment to advancing the field of computing and supporting the tech community.

<h2>Education and Work History</h2>
My journey in tech has been all about continuous learning, collaboration, and giving back to the community. Whether through open-source contributions, community events, writing, or mentorship, I aim to make a positive impact on the next generation of tech professionals and help others navigate this ever-evolving field.

I hold a Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering from the University of Kerala, graduating in 2004. Since then, my career has been a journey through diverse industries and technologies, each role adding new dimensions to my expertise.

I started at XStream Software, where I worked on award-winning simulation tools using C++ and MFC. It was a foundational experience that taught me the value of meticulous design and problem-solving. At Sapient, I built and enhanced enterprise-grade systems, including integrating multi-threaded search capabilities and Google Maps into business applications, further honing my skills in delivering complex solutions.

At Philips Healthcare, I worked on advanced imaging platforms like the IMALYTICS Workspace, where I developed tools for post-acquisition image analysis using C# and .NET. This role reinforced my interest in building technical solutions for specialized domains. Later, at Dell, as part of the eDell Center of Excellence team, I engineered web and Windows applications, setting infrastructure standards and automating deployments to streamline workflows.

At GEICO, I focused on creating .NET libraries and tools for seamless multi-layered business integrations, collaborating with offshore teams to deliver projects efficiently. A brief but impactful stint at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ allowed me to implement enterprise-grade solutions with technologies like ASP.NET MVC, WPF, and Web API, optimizing performance for business-critical applications.

During my nearly decade-long tenure at NYC School Construction Authority (SCA), I modernized legacy systems, developed mobile applications with Xamarin, and implemented scalable, secure solutions using C#, React, and Angular. My work directly supported high-visibility operational needs, setting new benchmarks for efficiency and reliability.

Today, as a Principal Software Engineer at LINK Logistics, I lead efforts to integrate AI into their technology stack, driving innovation in logistics and real estate. My journey has been shaped by roles that challenged me to innovate, adapt, and deliver solutions that make an impact. It’s a path that combines my passion for engineering with a commitment to continuous learning and problem-solving.
